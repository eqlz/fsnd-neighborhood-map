# Project Neighborhood Map

Users will see markers of the five stations upon opening the page.  A list of stations will appear on the left side of the page along with
a search bar.  Users can interact in following ways on the page:
- Clicking on each marker will let an info window pop up.
- Clicking a station on the list will make the info window of that station pop up.
- Search a certain station among the five via search bar on the left, and the list will update correspondingly, so will markers on the map.
